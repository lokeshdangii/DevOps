Sofware Development Life Cyclce (SDLC)
-------------------------------------------------------
-> The process of developing and delivering S/W project is called as SDLC.

-> In SDLC we have several phases -

1) Requirements Gathering.
2) Requirements Analysis.
3) Desing / Planning
4) Coding / Implementation / Development
5) Testing
6) Deploy
7) Deliver
8) Maintenance
  
DevOps is used in all the phases of SDLC.




Waterfall methodology:-
----------------------- 

-> Earlier people used to follow Waterfall methodology to develop project  --> Outdated approach, not used nowadays

-> Waterfall is a linear methodology to develop and delover projects

-> Everything is going to done step by step  

-> In Waterfall we will move only in forward direction
 
-> In this all the steps/phases are going to done one after the other.

-> Requirements are fixed

-> Budget is fixed

-> Client involvment is very less

-> Client will se the project at the end

-> If in the end if the client is not satisfied than the whole money and time will be wasted.

-> Waterfall Methodology is not suitable for big projects



Agile Methodology :- Overcome of Waterfall 
-------------------

-> Agile is an iterative approach to develop and deliver project

-> Development and Testing will happen parallely

-> Client involvment will be very high

-> We will deliver project in multiple releases (Sprints)

-> For every release we will take client feedback

-> Requirements are not fixed

-> Budget is not fixed

-> Nowadays agile methodology is followed in the industry.

-> Every release is called Sprint in this

-> Project Development, Testing, and Delivery are very frequent in Agile

-> Using DevOps culture we can adopt agile methodology very easily.

-> DevOps is promoting Agile methodology.

-> Using DevOps we can achieve CI & CD.


 
DevOps Advantages:-

    Speed
    Rapid Development
