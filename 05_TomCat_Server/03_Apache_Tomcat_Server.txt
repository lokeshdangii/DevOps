Apache Tomcat Server
++++++++++++++++++++



=> Apache Tomcat is a web Server

=> Apache Tomcat is used to run Java Web Applications

=> Apache Tomcat is free & open source

=> Apache Tomcat runs on 8080 port by default (we can change the port)




Apache Tomcat folder structure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


 bin : it contains commands to start and stop tomcat server

 conf : it contains configuration files

 lib : it contains libraries (jar files)

 logs : it contains server logs

 temp : temp files will be created here, we can delete them.

 webapps : This is called deployment folder.



Note : We will keep file in webapps folder for deployment. 

Ques : Can we deploy multiple war files in we folder? 
Ans : Yes we can deploy but not recommended. deploying multiple files on single server is not recommended but possible.



Working with Apache Tomcat in Linux
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-> Login into AWS Management Console
-> Create EC2 Instance
-> connect to EC2 Instance using MobaXterm/Putty/SSH
-> install java s/w using below command

    $sudo apt install java-1.8.0-openjdk

-> We can download apache tomcat from official website

-> we can find apache tomcat urls to download in official website download page

-> Copy the URL of tar file and execute below cmd in instance 

    $ wget <tomcat-tar-file-url>

-> After tomcat tar file got downloaded then extract tomacat tar file using tar cmd

    $ tar -xvf <tomcat-tar-file>

-> Go inside tomcat folder and see folder structure

-> Go to tomcat bin directory and run tomcat server

    $ cd bin
    $ ./startup.SSH

Note : Tomcat server runs on 8080 port by default. Enable this port in SG of EC2 instance as custom tcp.


-> Access Tomcat server form your browser.

    URL : http://EC2-Public-IP:8080/ 

Note : It should open tomcat server home page. 


=> By default the Host Manager is only accessible from a browser running on the same machine as Tomcat. If you wish to modify this restriction, you'll need to edit the Host Manager's context.xml file.

-> File Location : <tomcat>/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml

-> In manager context.xml file, change <Valve> section like below (allow attribute value changed)

<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
         allow=".*" />

 
=> Add tomcat users in tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml file like below
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


<role rolename="manager-gui" />
<user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui" />
<role rolename="admin-gui" />
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, admin-gui" />

    -> After that Stop and start the tomcat server from bin (restart)



-> When we change tomcat port number in server.xml file then we have to enable tht port in SG associated with our EC2 instance.
