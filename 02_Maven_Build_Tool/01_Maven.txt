Maven
-----------------

-> Maven is a free and open source s/w given by Apache Organisation.

-> Maven s/w is developed using Java programming language

-> Maven is used to perform Build Automation for Java projects.

-> Maven is called as Java Build Tool



What we can do using maven ?
-------------------------------

1) We can create initial project folder structure.
2) We can download project dependencies.
    (ex : springboot, hibernate, kafka, redis, mail, log4j, junit, security....etc)

Note: Required dependencies we will configure in "pom.xml"

-> pom stands for project object model

-> when we create maven project then pom.xml file will be created automatically

-> pom.xml will act as input file for maven s/w.

3) We can compile project source code using Maven

Note: Compilation means converting java source code into byte code
                        Compilation
        Demo.java ---------------------------> Demo.class

Note: java project means collection of java programs. 

4) We can package java project as jar or war file using maven.

    JAR - Java Archieve
    WAR - Web Archieve

 -> Standalone java applications will be executed as a jar file

 -> java Web application will be executed as a war file.

 -> Standalone application means which will only execute in one computer. ex:- Calculator


    
                  compile                     package           deployment
1000 .java files ========> 1000 .class files =========> war  =================> Web Server (irctc.war)





Note: 1 lakh .class files can be packaged as one war files and that one war file is deployed (sent) to the server
