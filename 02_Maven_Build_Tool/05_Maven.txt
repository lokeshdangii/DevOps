Session 8

Whenever we add dependencies in pom.xml file?

First maven will search for the dependency in local repository.

If local repository contains that dependency maven will take that dependency and add it to the project build path

-> If dependency not available in local repository then maven will connect to Central Repository or Remote Repository based on our Configuration.

Note: By default maven will connect with central repository. If we want to use remote repository then we need to configure remote repository details.

Note: Every S/W company will maintain their own remote repository (Ex: JFrog)
 
Configuring Remote Repository

<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>id</id>
        <url>jfrog-repo-url</url>
    <repository>
</repositories>




Maven Goals
+++++++++++

-> To perform project build activities maven provided several Goals

    Clean
    compile
    test
    package
    install

-> clean goal is used to delete target folder in maven

-> compile goal is used to compile project source code. Compiled code will be stored in the target folder.

                compile
        .java ------------> .class

-> Test goal is used to execute unit test code of our application (junit code)

-> package goal is used to generate jar or war file for our application based on packaging type available in pom.xml jar or war file will be created in target folder.

-> install goal is used to install our project as dependency in maven local repository.

Note: Every maven goal is associated with maven plugin. When we execute maven goal then respective maven plugin will execute to perform the operation.

Syntax: mvn <goal-name>

Note: We need to execute maven goals from project folder
