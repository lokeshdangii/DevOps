Email Notification in Jenkins
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-> We can configure Email Notification in Jenkins

-> With this option we can send email notification to team members after jenkins job execution completed.

-> We need to configure SMTP properties to send mails

    1) Go to Manage Jenkins
    2) Add Email Extension Server
    3) We will add company provided SMTP server details

Note:  For practise we can use Gmail SMTP properties.
 
-> Once SMTP properties addded then we can configure email notifications as 'Post Build Action' in Jenkins job.
