Jenkins Pipeline
+++++++++++++++++


-> Sequence of Jobs execution is called as Pipeline

-> For our application we will have multiple environments.

-> For every environment, one Jenkins job will be created

    JENKINS_DEV_JOB -----------> DEV Environment (DEV Server)
    JENKINS_SIT_JOB -----------> SIT Environment (SIT Server)
    JENKINS_UAT_JOB -----------> UAT Environment (UAT Server)
    JENKINS_PILOT_JOB -----------> Pilot Environment (Pilot Server)
    JENKINS_PROD_JOB -----------> Prod Environment (Prod Server)


-> If we want to deploy code changes to all environments then it is recommended to create Build Pipeline.

-> By using Build Pipeline we can execute JENKINS jobs sequentially.



Requirements
++++++++++++

-> If code commit happened in github then deploy code into Dev Server.

-> If DEV Server Deployment successfull, then deploy code into SIT environment

-> If SIT Server deployment successful, then deploy code into UAT environment.



Steps to Create Jenkins Pipeline
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) Create EC2 VM and install Tomcat Server (DEV Server)

2) Create EC2 VM and install Tomcat Server (DEV Server)

3) Create EC2 VM and install Tomcat Server (DEV Server)

4) Create EC2 VM and install Jenkins (Jenkins Server VM) 

5) Install JDK, Maven, Git, Deploy to Container in the EC2 in which Jenkins s/w installed.

6) Create Jobs in Jenkins Server.

        Dev-Job ----> Dev Server

        SIT-Job ----> SIT Server (SIT Job execute if DEV-JOb is stable)

        UAT-JOb ----> UAT Server  (UAT Job should execute if SIT-JOB is stable)

7) Create Jenkins Build Pipeline to execute Jobs in Sequence.
