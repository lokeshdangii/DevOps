========================================
Jenkins - Master & Slave Architecture
========================================

=> If we use single machine jenkins, then burden will be increased if we run multiple jobs at a time. 

=> If burden increased then system can crash.

=> To reduce burden on jenkins server we will use Master & Slave Configuration.

=> Master & Slave configuration is used to reduce burden on Jenkins Server by distributing tasks/load.


================
Jenkins Master
=================

=> The machine which contains Jenkins s/w is called as Jenkins Master machine.

=> It is used to create the jobs

=> It is used to schedule the jobs

=> It is responsible to distribute Jobs execution to slave machines.

Note: We can run jobs on Jenkins Master machine directley but not recommended.

==============
Jenkins Slave
==============

=> The machine which is connected with 'Jenkins Master' machine is called as 'Jenkins-Slave' machine.

=> Slave Machine will recieve task from 'Master Machine' for job execution.


===================================
Step-1 : Create Jenkins Master vm
===================================

1) Launch Linux VM (t2.medium)
2) Install Java s/w
3) Install Jenkins s/w

==================================
Step-2 : Create Jenkins Slave vm
==================================

1) Create EC2 instance (Ubuntu with t2.micro)
2) Connect to EC2 using ssh client
3) Change hostname for readability

	$ sudo hostname jenkins-slave
	$ exit

3) Install Java Software

		$ sudo apt install default-jre

4) Create one directory in /home/ubuntu

			$ mkdir slavenode

=====================================================
Step-3: Configure Slave Node in Jenkins Master Node
=====================================================		

1) Go to Jenkins Dashboard
2) Go to Manage Jenkins
3) Select Nodes option
4) Click on 'New Node' -> Enter Node Name -> Select Permanent Agent
5) Enter Remote Root Directory ( /home/ubuntu/slavenode )
6) Enter Label name as Slave-1
7) Select Launch Method as 'Launch Agent Via SSH'
8) Give Host as 'Slave VM DNS URL'
9) Add Credentials ( Select Kind as : SSH Username with private key )
10) Enter Username as : ubuntu
11) Select Private Key as Enter Directley and add private key

Note: Open pem file and copy content and add 

12) Select Host Key Strategy as 'Manually Trusted Key Verification Strategy'

13) Click on Apply and Save (We can see configured slave)


*********** With above steps Master and Slave Configuration Completed ****************

-> Go to Jenkins Server and Create Jenkins Job

Note: Under General Section of Job creation process, Select "Restrict Where This Project Can Run" and enter Slave Nodel Label name and finish job creation.

-> Execute the Job using 'Build Now' option

Note: Job will be executed on Slave Node (Go to Job Console Ouput and verify execution details)
